## ðŸš€ Quick Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run the Database Schema

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### If you see "Failed to load performance data":
- This is normal when there's no data yet
- Run the mock data script to see realistic metrics
- The system will show default values (0.0) without data

### If you see database errors:
- Make sure you're running the scripts in the correct Supabase project
- Check that you have the necessary permissions
- Verify both scripts ran completely without errors
- Ensure the `profiles` table exists (required for agent data)

### If mock data doesn't appear:
- Check that the `profiles` table has agents with `role = 'agent'`
- Verify the user authentication is working
- Check the RLS policies are correctly applied
